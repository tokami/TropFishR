calculated from the catch curve (only if \code{cumulative = FALSE})}

\item{reg_int}{instead of using the identity method a range can be determined,
which is to be used for the regression analysis. If equal to NULL identity method
is applied (default). For multiple regression lines provide list with the two points
for the regression line in each element of the list.}

data. Default 1.}

\description{
This function applies the (length-converted) linearised catch
   curve to age composition and length-frequency data,
   respectively. It allows to estimate the instantaneous total mortality rate (Z).
   Optionally, the gear selectivity can be estimated and the cumulative catch
   curve cna be applied.
}
\details{
This function includes the \link{identify} function, which asks you to
  choose two points from a graph manually. The two points which you choose by clicking
  on the plot in the graphical device represent the start and end of the data points,
  which should be used for the analysis. Based on these points the regression line
  is calculated.
  When the selection ogive
  is calculated by means of the catch curve the assumption is made, that Z is constant
  for all year classes or length groups, respectively. Accoring to Sparre and Venema
  (1998) this assumption might be true, because F is smaller for young fish
  (Selectivity) while M is higher for young fish (high natural mortality). The selectivity
  for not fully exploited old fish (e.g. due to gillnet fishery) can not be calculated yet
  by use of the catch curve.
  Based on the format of the list argument \code{catch} and whether the argument
  \code{catch_columns} is defined, the function automatically
  distinguishes between the catch curve with variable parameter system (if catch is a
  vector) and the one with constant parameter system (if catch is a matrix or a
  data.frame and \code{catch_columns = NA}). In the case of the variable parameter
  system the catches of one year are
  assumed to represent the catches during the entire life span of a so called
  pseudo-cohort.
  The cumulative catch curve does not allow for the estimation of the selectivity
  ogive.
